# PingPlugin
A simple plugin that adds a command to see your and other player's ping in-game!

### The Plugin
This is a lightweight plugin, from a series of modular plugins, made just for you to select the ones you want, without any stress and dependencies overcrowding you plugins folder.
Other plugins like these are:

* [WarpPlugin](https://github.com/Agentew04/WarpPlugin)
* [MoneyPlugin](https://github.com/Agentew04/MoneyPlugin)

### Installing

1. Download the `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/Agentew04/PingPlugin/releases/latest)
2. Drop it in your server's plugin folder
3. Start the server
4. You're good to go! Happy Pinging everyone!

### Using
The plugin implements 1 command to be used in two ways:

* `/ping` => Shows your current ping;
* `/ping <Player>` => Displays the current ping from another player;

### Disclaimer
This plugin does not add any permissions, as i think they're quite useless for a harmless ping command.
